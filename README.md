## JavaScript String Manipulation and Methods

### 1\. String Interpolation (Template Literals)

In JavaScript, a modern way to concatenate strings and variables is by using **template literals**. This allows for more readable code and easier insertion of variables into strings.

Example:

```javascript
let variable = "JavaScript";
console.log(`This is the representation of the string: ${variable} &lt;- this is how we include variables in the string.`);
```

The `${variable}` syntax inside backticks (`` ` ``) allows you to embed expressions directly into the string.

### 2\. Common String Methods

JavaScript offers several useful methods to manipulate strings. Here are some commonly used methods:

`variable.length`: Returns the length of the string.

`variable.toUpperCase()`: Converts the entire string to uppercase.

`variable.toLowerCase()`: Converts the entire string to lowercase.

`variable.charAt(index)`: Returns the character at the specified index (0-based).

`variable.substring(start, end)`: Extracts characters from the string starting at `start` and up to (but not including) the `end` index.

`variable.slice(start, end)`: Similar to `substring()`, but also supports negative indices, allowing you to slice from the end of the string.

`variable.trim()`: Removes leading and trailing white spaces, which is especially useful for cleaning input data in forms.

`variable.replace('oldValue', 'newValue')`: Replaces a specified substring or character with a new one in the string.

`variable.includes('substring')`: Checks if the string contains the given substring. Returns `true` or `false`.

`variable.split(separator)`: Splits the string into an array of substrings based on the specified separator. Example:

### 3\. Removing Leading and Trailing White Spaces and Reducing Multiple Spaces

In some cases, you may want to not only remove leading and trailing white spaces but also reduce any extra spaces within the string to a single space. This can be achieved by combining `trim()` with `replace()` using a regular expression.

Example:

```javascript
let str = "   Hello   World!   ";
let cleanedStr = str.trim().replace(/\s+/g, ' ');
console.log(cleanedStr);  // Output: "Hello World!"
```

In this example, `trim()` removes leading and trailing spaces, and `replace(/\s+/g, ' ')` replaces multiple spaces within the string with a single space.

```javascript
let str = "my-name-is";
let result = str.split('-');  // ['my', 'name', 'is']
```

## Stack and Heap Memory in JavaScript

In JavaScript, memory is managed using two main types of storage: **stack** and **heap**. Each plays a critical role in how variables are stored and accessed, depending on whether the data is primitive or non-primitive.

### 1. Stack
The **stack** is used to store **primitive values** like numbers, strings, booleans, `null`, and `undefined`. The key feature of stack memory is that it stores copies of the values directly. This means that each variable has its own separate copy, and changing one variable does not affect the others.

Example (Stack memory):
```javascript
let myEmail = "prathameshpise6@gmail.com";
let newEmail = myEmail;
```
In the above code, both `myEmail` and `newEmail` store their values separately in the stack. Even though `newEmail` is initially assigned the value of `myEmail`, it gets its own copy of the value.

```javascript
newEmail = "theprathamesh07@gmail.com";
console.log(myEmail);  // Output: "prathameshpise6@gmail.com"
console.log(newEmail);  // Output: "theprathamesh07@gmail.com"
```
Here, changing `newEmail` does not affect `myEmail` because primitive data types are stored independently in the stack.

### 2. Heap
The **heap** is used for storing **non-primitive values** like objects and arrays. When you assign an object to a variable, only the **reference** to the object is stored in the stack, while the actual object is stored in the heap. Multiple variables can reference the same object in heap memory, meaning that changes made through one reference will affect the others.

Example (Heap memory):
```javascript
let firstVal = {
    id: 101,
    name: 'abc',
};

let secVal = firstVal;  // Both variables reference the same object in heap memory
```
In this example, both `firstVal` and `secVal` reference the same object in the heap, so any changes made to one will reflect in the other.

```javascript
secVal.id = 102;
console.log(firstVal);  // Output: { id: 102, name: 'abc' }
console.log(secVal);    // Output: { id: 102, name: 'abc' }
```
Since both variables point to the same object in the heap, modifying `secVal` also modifies `firstVal`. They share the same reference, so both log the same object.

### Key Differences
- **Stack memory** is used for primitive values (like numbers and strings) and stores actual values.
- **Heap memory** is used for non-primitive values (like objects and arrays) and stores references to these values.
- **Primitive types** do not affect each other because they are stored independently.
- **Non-primitive types** (such as objects) share the same reference, so changes to one variable can affect others referencing the same object.

## Working with Arrays in JavaScript

Arrays in JavaScript are dynamic and can hold multiple values of different types, such as numbers, strings, and booleans. They allow for storing, manipulating, and accessing a list of elements in a single variable.

### 1. Array Initialization

There are different ways to initialize arrays in JavaScript:

- Using square brackets `[]` (literal notation):
  ```javascript
  const myArr = [1, 2, 3, 'a', true];
  console.log(myArr);  // Output: [1, 2, 3, "a", true]
  ```
  This method allows an array to store mixed data types (numbers, strings, booleans, etc.).

- Using the `Array` constructor:
  ```javascript
  const myArray2 = new Array(1, 2, 3, 4);
  console.log(myArray2);  // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
  ```

Arrays in JavaScript are **dynamic**, meaning their size can change, and you can add or remove elements at runtime.

### 2. Shallow Copy (Stack and Heap Reference)

JavaScript arrays are stored in heap memory, meaning when you assign an array to another variable, youâ€™re copying the **reference** (not the actual array). This can lead to unintended behavior when modifying arrays.

Example:
```javascript
let originalArr = [1, 2, 3];
let copiedArr = originalArr;  // Shallow copy, both point to the same array in heap memory
copiedArr.push(4);
console.log(originalArr);  // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4] (modified)
console.log(copiedArr);    // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4] (same)
```

### 3. Array Methods

JavaScript provides several built-in methods to work with arrays:

1. **`push(value)`**: Adds a value to the end of the array.
   ```javascript
   myArr.push(7);
   console.log(myArr);  // Output: [1, 2, 3, "a", true, 7]
   ```

2. **`pop()`**: Removes the last value from the array.
   ```javascript
   myArr.pop();
   console.log(myArr);  // Output: [1, 2, 3, "a", true]
   ```

3. **`unshift(value)`**: Inserts a value at the start of the array.
   ```javascript
   myArr.unshift(9);
   console.log(myArr);  // Output: [9, 1, 2, 3, "a", true]
   ```
   Note: This operation can be time-consuming because it shifts all elements.

4. **`shift()`**: Removes the first value from the array.
   ```javascript
   myArr.shift();
   console.log(myArr);  // Output: [1, 2, 3, "a", true]
   ```

5. **`join()`**: Joins the elements of an array into a string.
   ```javascript
   let joinedArr = myArr.join('-');
   console.log(joinedArr);  // Output: "1-2-3-a-true"
   ```

6. **`slice(start, end)`**: Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.
   ```javascript
   let slicedArr = myArr.slice(1, 3);
   console.log(slicedArr);  // Output: [2, 3]
   ```

7. **`splice(index, numToDelete)`**: Adds/removes elements to/from an array and modifies the original array.
   ```javascript
   myArr.splice(1, 2);  // Removes 2 elements starting from index 1
   console.log(myArr);  // Output: [1, "a", true]
   ```

8. **`concat(array)`**: Combines two or more arrays into one.
   ```javascript
   let arr1 = [1, 2];
   let arr2 = [3, 4];
   let combinedArr = arr1.concat(arr2);
   console.log(combinedArr);  // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
   ```

9. **`flat(depth)`**: Flattens nested arrays to the specified depth.
   ```javascript
   let nestedArr = [1, [2, [3, [4]]]];
   console.log(nestedArr.flat(2));  // Output: [1, 2, 3, [4]]
   ```

10. **`Array.from(string)`**: Converts a string into an array.
    ```javascript
    let str = "hello";
    let arrFromString = Array.from(str);
    console.log(arrFromString);  // Output: ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
    ```

### 4. Passing Arrays Inside Arrays

You can nest arrays within other arrays, which results in a multi-dimensional array:
```javascript
let nestedArray = [[1, 2], [3, 4]];
console.log(nestedArray);  // Output: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
```
To flatten such nested arrays, you can use the `flat()` method as shown earlier.
